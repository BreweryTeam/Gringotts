## Some more info on Malts (for those who aren't familiar):

- Malts is an open-source plugin that allows players to use vaults and a warehouse to store items.


### Vaults
Vaults are virtual chests that players may use to store items of their choosing. They work very similarly to vaults
from the "PlayerVaults" plugin. Malts includes a GUI to show players their vaults in a nice and orderly fashion.
Player can customize, change the name, and even trust other players to their vaults to share them! The amount of
vaults a player can access is configurable and dynamically modifiable through commands!


### Warehouse
Every player get their own warehouse. Players can store materials in large quantities in their warehouse. The amount
of material they can store is based on their maximum stock which is configurable through commands and/or permissions.
The warehouse also has additional features such as "auto storing", "click to deposit", and "auto replenish".

### Importing
Malts supports importing vaults from "PlayerVaults" currently. More importers will be added closer to Malts' first
non-beta release.

### Quickbar
In the vaults gui,
a quickbar showing the most recently accessed warehouse compartments is available for player convenience.
This can be configured.

### QuickReturn
Players can right-click outside any Malts gui to return to "Your Vaults" gui. This can be configured.

Malts has other nuanced features too.
As stated before, this project is in **beta** and should not be used on production servers at the moment.
Malts only supports PaperMC-based servers.
